Have summarised and consolidated the feedback below.

 1.⁠ ⁠Please use the flag "Display on website" in Coda to display the events, as some events are not to be displayed e.g. Malta Hanuman Chalisa. 
 2.⁠ ⁠For the events that are displayed on the right side, can we please display the following information:
•⁠  ⁠Replace Town/Event name with the Organisation name from Coda
•⁠  ⁠Replace the wings in the blue boxes with the topic i.e Hanuman Chalisa Decoded, Bhagavad Gita Decoded, Bhajans (you may need to use alternative texts here - please let us know if this is feasible)
•⁠  ⁠For the location, please use the address field from Coda
•⁠  ⁠Date and time can remain as they are
 3.⁠ ⁠Phone number should be optional. Can we add some text along the lines of "Please enter your phone number if you wish to be added to our WhatsApp community for Chinmaya Mission related events" @⁨Vijay CMUK⁩  please feel free to edit this to something more appropriate ☺️🙏🏽
14.⁠ ⁠Any chance to add in the second half of the CM75 event info? Its the kind of about us section that people might find useful:

12.⁠ ⁠Could we add a GDPR statement please to the bottom of the form: 
"Your details will be used only to keep you informed about this event and related activities. We respect your privacy and will never share your information with external organisations.”
 4.⁠ ⁠Think we keep it as “which event would you like to register for” as its important to drive people to action. Also prefer ‘event’ rather than ‘program’
 5.⁠ ⁠⁠Again I prefer Your Location to region and definitely prefer to County as the drop down is in geographical areas currently. Will make it easier to follow up with events in their orbit. Ekta: would suggest to add Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Northern Ireland, since it is part of the UK
 6.⁠ ⁠⁠Please bold field names to help it stand out
 7.⁠ ⁠⁠Live events to have flyer
 8.⁠ ⁠⁠For all other events display text “Further information to follow”
 9.⁠ ⁠Container with scroll bar for the events section
10.⁠ ⁠⁠Mobile view will need some fixes so the blue boxes don't disappear off the page
11.⁠ ⁠I think we should have a column on the dashboard so organisers can see how many people are planning to attend. SPJ had asked this weekend and think its a good idea to know how much to ramp up on marketing should we need to
13.⁠ ⁠Think we should have an option for ‘Outside of the UK’ on the Location
